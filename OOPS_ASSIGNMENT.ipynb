        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming is a way of writing computer programs using objects — like real-world things.\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) is a way of writing programs using objects, which are made from classes.\n",
        "OOPS helps in organizing code to make it easier to understand, reuse, and manage.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOPS?\n",
        "- Class is A blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOPS?\n",
        "- Object is  An instance of a class.It contains actual data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class).It helps protect internal object state (e.g., using private variables).\n",
        "- Abstraction is Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        " - Dunder methods are special methods in Python whose names start and end with double underscores — hence the name \"dunder\" (short for \"double underscore\").\n",
        " - Example of Dunder Methods:\n",
        "__init__() – runs when you create an object\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__() – runs when you print an object\n",
        "\n",
        "__len__() – runs when you call len() on an object\n",
        "\n",
        "__add__() – runs when you use the + operator\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPs?\n",
        "- Inheritance means in One class inherits attributes and methods from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOPS?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is The ability to use a unified interface for different data types or classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation means hiding the internal details of how something works and only showing what is necessary.\n",
        "- In Python, encapsulation is achieved using:\n",
        "- Classes – to group data and methods together\n",
        "- Access modifiers – to control visibility of variables and methods\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor is a special method in a class that runs automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "In Python, the constructor method is called __init__().\n",
        "- To initialize (set up) the object’s data (variables) when it's created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class Method\n",
        "Belongs to the class, not to any one object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can access or change class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "First argument is cls (not self), which refers to the class itself.\n",
        "- Static Method\n",
        "Doesn't access class or object data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Used for utility/helper functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Uses the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "No self or cls as first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method Overloading means creating multiple methods with the same name but different number or types of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOPS?\n",
        "- Method overriding means a child class (subclass) defines a method with the same name as one in the parent class, but with different behavior.\n",
        "- Used to change or extend the functionality of a method inherited from a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The property decorator is used to turn a method into a \"read-only\" attribute.\n",
        "It lets you access a method like a variable, without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOPS?\n",
        "- Code Reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "You can write one function that works for many types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoids repeating code for each object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flexibility and Extensibility\n",
        "\n",
        "You can add new classes with different behavior, without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        " Makes your program easier to grow and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Cleaner Code\n",
        "\n",
        "You don’t need to check object types manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just call the method — Python handles the rest.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Improves Readability\n",
        "\n",
        "Same method names across different classes make code easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be directly used to create objects.\n",
        "It’s like a template — it tells what methods must be written in any class that inherits from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOPS?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers many benefits that make programs easier to build, manage, and scale.\n",

        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared by all objects. Like a rule for the whole class.Belongs to\tThe class itself,Shared by\tAll objects of the class,Defined using\tInside the class, outside any method,Accessed using\tClassName.var or object.var\n",
        "- Instance variable: Belongs to one object only. Like personal info.A specific object (instance).Only the object that owns it.Inside the class, within a method (usually __init__).Only via the object: object.var\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple Inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class.Reuse code from multiple classes.Combine features of different classes into one.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.  Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- __str__() – User-Friendly String\n",

        "- Helps with constructor chaining\n",
        "- Makes multiple inheritance safer and more manageable\n",
        "- Supports method overriding properly\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- To clean up resources like files, network connections, or memory when the object is no longer needed.\n",
        "- Acts like a goodbye function for an object.\n",
        "- It is a special method that runs automatically when an object is about to be destroyed\n",
        "\n",
        "22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        "A @staticmethod is a method that does not need access to either the class (cls) or the object (self). It's just a regular function that happens to live inside a class. We use it when the method doesn't need to know anything about the class or its instances, but logically, it belongs inside the class (for better organization).\n",
        "-  @classmethod\n",
        "A @classmethod have access to the class. It takes cls as its first parameter, which refers to the class itself, not the object. You use it when you need to work with class-level data, like modifying class variables or creating objects in a special way (known as factory methods).\n",
        "It’s useful when your method needs to know which class it's working with, when we dealing with inheritance or class configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Python means that a single method name can do different things, depending on which class is calling it.\n",
        "When we use inheritance, child classes can override methods from the parent class, and Python decides at runtime which version of the method to call.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOPS?\n",
        "- Method chaining means calling multiple methods one after another on the same object — all in a single line — like a chain.\n",
        "This is possible when each method returns the object itself, usually using return self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__() method in Python makes an object behave like a function.\n",
        "It allows you to call an object as if it were a regular function.\n",
        "- Add function-like behavior to your class instances\n",
        "- Use objects as function wrappers, counters, loggers, or handlers\n",
